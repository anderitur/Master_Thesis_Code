# Master_Thesis_Code

This repository has all the code used in for this master thesis. The code have been developed in two programming Languages: *Python* and *R*. In this repository, it will be included also all the csv/json files needed to replicate the code.

## Python

All the code was done in Jupyter notebooks and we did the following tasks with this language:

* Data preprocessing
* Data Enrichment
* LSTM model

## R

All the code was done in raw R files and we did the following tasks with this language:

* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Error calculation from LSTM model
* Bayesian Poisson-Gamma model
